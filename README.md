# Person Following using End-to-End Deep Learning
## Overview
 This program is used for it which the robot follows person. The robot has [Realsense D435 camera](https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d435/) and [Kobuki base](http://kobuki.yujinrobot.com/about2/). I'll present about this research at [SICE SI in 2019](https://www.sice-si.org/conf/si2019/).
